# Getting started

General information about installing Ansible and setting up your environment, and more can be found in the (Installing Ansible Guide)[https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html].

Information about boto library usage and more about Amazon Web Services modules can be found in the (Ansible AWS Guidelines documentation)[https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/scenario_guides/guide_aws.html].

## AWS Collections Dependencies

This collection depends on two existing AWS collections: 
- (`amazon.aws`)[https://galaxy.ansible.com/amazon/aws]
- (`community.aws`)[https://galaxy.ansible.com/community/aws]

"New modules and plugins developed by the community should be proposed to `community.aws`. 
Content in this collection that is stable and meets other acceptance criteria has the potential to be promoted and migrated into `amazon.aws`."
